DIFFICULT QUERIES:
1. acm

3. business information management
- These gave us pretty random results initially, but improved upon emphasizing bolded/titled/heading words

5. can i minor in informatics
- These queries were greatly improved from no/little results to relevant ones by removing common "stop phrases" at the beginning of the query
6. a faculty
7. the research lab

- Correctly implementing the tf-idf formula (which originally wasn't properly accounting for idf) removed the undue weight on common words like "a", "the", etc.

10. software master computer master engineering master
- Removing repeated query words greatly improved the time and score accuracy for these queries
