***Indexing:***

To start the index creation, navigate to indexer.py, make sure:
1. File path to your *DEV* folder is correctly written (unzip directly into the main folder of your directory)
2. Create the partial index folder if you haven't yet

Once you do the two steps above, run "python indexer.py" from the command line to start the index creation.


***Searching:***

**AFTER** completing the indexing program, to begin the Search program, go into ***app.py*** and run the ***if __name__ == '__main__'***.
If running from command line, type "python app.py"

In the console, it should give you a link to the server. Click on the link and you should be able to 
run the search program. Enter any desired queries and see the output on your screen.

* Alternatively, to run entirely from the command line, enter "python search.py"

Time to retrieve results pre-GUI and ranking will be seen in the command line.
